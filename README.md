# "SaaSMon"
Site Version Checking and Tracking app built on FastAPI

This tool will be used in my day job to monitor and track changes we make to our SaaS environment to speed up my deployment/upgrade efforts and minimize delays due to dependency issues.

# Key Libraries
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy w/ Postgres
- Pydantic
- Jose (JWT)

# Roadmap
I do not have an explicit roadmap in mind. However, my goal is to commit to this repo daily as I learn more about FastAPI and SQLAlchemy.
My hope is to have a fully functional API and back-end ready before the end of March and begin to build out a front-end after that.

By the end of the project, this will be a fully-featured API with authentication (JWT), reverse proxy, containerized with Docker, use of Github Actions for CI/CD, testing with Pytest, Github Secrets, and ultimately deployed on AWS.
