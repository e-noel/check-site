# "SaaSMon"
Site Version Checking and Tracking app built on FastAPI

This tool will be used in my day job to monitor and track changes we make to our SaaS environment to speed up my deployment/upgrade efforts and minimize delays due to dependency issues.

# stack
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- uvicorn in development

# roadmap
I do not have an explicit roadmap in mind. However, my goal is to commit to this repo daily as I learn more about FastAPI and SQLAlchemy.
My hope is to have a fully functional API ready within a month and begin to build out a front-end after that.
